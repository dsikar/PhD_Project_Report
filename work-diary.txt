Join Slack channels for Autoware and City Autonomous Driving Research.

Contacted Radu Jianu with respect to supporting labs in Term 2.

Looked up Carla simulator on Twitter, account seems stale since December 2020, seemingly date of last major release.

Join Carla Simulator on discord, this seems to be quite a vibrant community.

Autoware source code repository on github:
https://github.com/Autoware-AI/simulation

https://www.autoware.org/ , reported to be powering self-driving cars in Japan since 2017.

Read an earlier slack post which led to this discussions:
https://answers.ros.org/question/377659/occupangygrid-map-issue-ray_ground_filter-fails-to-generate-costmap-on-autowareai/

" I strongly suggest to use Apollo.Auto AD stack from Baidu instead Autoware. The perception module does not fail!!! And Autoware.AI project seems that is not more supported."

"Apollo.Auto AD baidu" google search:

https://apollo.auto/
https://apollo.auto/platform/simulation.html
https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo

This is a very vibrant community.

LG also has a simulator, Unity based, which "currently has integration with The Autoware Foundation's Autoware.auto and Baidu's Apollo platforms"

https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator

Some decisions required at this point. Do we install Carla/Apollo/Autoware in another box, and leave current box as dedicated Unity/Depth completion workstation?

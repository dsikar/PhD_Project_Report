Issues logging into Microsoft teams with new issued email. Will need to contact service desk.

Alternatively, using with Microsoft Edge, and awaiting request to join CUoL-Doctoral Researchers channel, then hopefully get induction info.

Documents examined so far - Offer Notes.pdf and research_student_guide.pdf are appended in email with subject header "MPhil/PhD in Computer Science (full time) (JUL Entry) 2020/1 Offer, Student ID: 180036287"

Todos:

1. Add slides (pdf format) presented at PhD interview to appendix
2. Add PhD project proposal (pdf format) to appendix

Sorted out ID Card, to be collected today, hopefully with access to A304 University Building.
Saw some induction videos in the CUoL-Doctoral Researchers Teams group.
Desk and PC to be allocated in the coming days for the July starters.

Join Slack channels for Autoware and City Autonomous Driving Research.

Contacted Radu Jianu with respect to supporting labs in Term 2.

Looked up Carla simulator on Twitter, account seems stale since December 2020, seemingly date of last major release.

Join Carla Simulator on discord, this seems to be quite a vibrant community.

Autoware source code repository on github:
https://github.com/Autoware-AI/simulation

https://www.autoware.org/ , reported to be powering self-driving cars in Japan since 2017.

Read an earlier slack post which led to this discussions:
https://answers.ros.org/question/377659/occupangygrid-map-issue-ray_ground_filter-fails-to-generate-costmap-on-autowareai/

" I strongly suggest to use Apollo.Auto AD stack from Baidu instead Autoware. The perception module does not fail!!! And Autoware.AI project seems that is not more supported."

"Apollo.Auto AD baidu" google search:

https://apollo.auto/
https://apollo.auto/platform/simulation.html
https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo

This is a very vibrant community.

LG also has a simulator, Unity based, which "currently has integration with The Autoware Foundation's Autoware.auto and Baidu's Apollo platforms"

https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator

Some decisions required at this point. Do we install Carla/Apollo/Autoware in another box, and leave current box as dedicated Unity/Depth completion workstation?

4. Self-driving platforms
5. Safecomp
6. ClearGrasp

Reading through:

1. A Neural-Symbolic Cognitive Agent for Online Learning and Reasoning

and

2. ERIC: Extracting Relations Inferred from Convolutions

Added references.

1. Admin

Enrolment still not confirmed? Chasing it up with Ann Marie.

2. SAFECOMP word cloud

Scholarly (searching google scholar) seems to have broken. Semantic Scholar searches by ID only, e.g. the search "Safety Verification of Multiple Autonomous Systems by Formal Approach" will return no matches while the corresponding ID e.g. "10.1007/978-3-319-10557-4_3".

TODOS

1. Artur articles x2
2. LG Self Driving 
3. OpenSD renders
4. Arxiv
5. Continue with AI applied to literature review

Asking around about NLP/NLU/data visualisation applied to literature survey.

Suggestions from A. Slingsby and N. Andrienko. No source code.

Running predictions off lambda functions on AWS. This might come in handy if we have multiple models and running all predictive models on same hardware is not feasible.

Lit. review. Drilling down on SAFECOMP conferences and word clouds. Touched base with Mirela - PhD candidate at giCentre.

Getting the 3D reconstruction demo ready for August 5th meeting, showing point clouds with acquired (noisy) transparent object detail and predicted (clean) transparent object 3D reconstruction.

From Ernesto Ruiz:

 Here you can find some resources about Knowledge Graphs https://github.com/turing-knowledge-graphs/teaching/tree/main/city
This is the module I gave to Judith and Eduard in case you are interested.

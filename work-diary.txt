Join Slack channels for Autoware and City Autonomous Driving Research.

Contacted Radu Jianu with respect to supporting labs in Term 2.

Looked up Carla simulator on Twitter, account seems stale since December 2020, seemingly date of last major release.

Join Carla Simulator on discord, this seems to be quite a vibrant community.

Autoware source code repository on github:
https://github.com/Autoware-AI/simulation

https://www.autoware.org/ , reported to be powering self-driving cars in Japan since 2017.

Read an earlier slack post which led to this discussions:
https://answers.ros.org/question/377659/occupangygrid-map-issue-ray_ground_filter-fails-to-generate-costmap-on-autowareai/

" I strongly suggest to use Apollo.Auto AD stack from Baidu instead Autoware. The perception module does not fail!!! And Autoware.AI project seems that is not more supported."

"Apollo.Auto AD baidu" google search:

https://apollo.auto/
https://apollo.auto/platform/simulation.html
https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo

This is a very vibrant community.

LG also has a simulator, Unity based, which "currently has integration with The Autoware Foundation's Autoware.auto and Baidu's Apollo platforms"

https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator

Some decisions required at this point. Do we install Carla/Apollo/Autoware in another box, and leave current box as dedicated Unity/Depth completion workstation?

Note Cosine similarity is incomplete - code broken. A few more to go:

Overlap Coefficient:

    This is the size of the intersection of the sets divided by the size of the smaller of the two sets.
    Formula: O(A,B)=∣A∩B∣min⁡(∣A∣,∣B∣)O(A,B)=min(∣A∣,∣B∣)∣A∩B∣​

Dice's Coefficient (Sørensen–Dice coefficient):

    This is twice the size of the intersection of the sets divided by the sum of the sizes of the two sets.
    Formula: D(A,B)=2∣A∩B∣∣A∣+∣B∣D(A,B)=∣A∣+∣B∣2∣A∩B∣​

Hamming Distance:

    If the reference lists are treated as binary vectors (similar to the cosine similarity approach), the Hamming distance can be used to measure the difference between the two vectors. This would give a measure of dissimilarity, which can be converted to similarity.

Tanimoto Coefficient:

    It is equivalent to Jaccard similarity for binary data.

Afterwards - tomorrow (sunday) start structuring, paper, references, result figures, tables, etc.

Oops, to be continued.

****************
** 2023.09.30 **
****************

Worked on understanding the code to generate predictions and distance metrics.
Next, splice in perturbation, distance metrics, to be computed at test time.

****************
** 2023.10.01 **
****************

Stopped at mnist_cnn_eval.py. Continue with adding results to dictionary, then going over other perturbations e.g. zoom.

****************
** 2023.10.04 **
****************

Adding pertubation levels dictionary to iterate through for every perturbation type.

****************
** 2023.10.07 **
****************

Generating heat maps for perturbations levels, like the work done in ECAI-2023-Sikar-Garcez.

We need to get into the habit of generating references for our figures, that is, whenever we see a figure in text, we need a reference to some experiment ID to be found in the appendix of the PhD, with a reference to source code.

Writing code to generate data for Google Drive/PhD/ ICLR2024 - Perturbations excel spreadsheet in one go.

Stopped at brightness, using getattr, and passing dictionary of values. Note, this might need tweaking as it is not yet clear if we pass the dictionary or a list with the dictionary.

TODO fix issues:

We have issues with the mnist_cnn_eval.py:

1. Histogram intersection is returning values great than 1, this is wrong, maximum value should be 1:

2. contrast has thrown and error when taking the mean of the image.

****************
** 2023.10.14 **
****************

We need to write unit tests to investigate the issues.

Load one image, pass to each function, in turn.

Need to fix:

1. image tensor passed as arguments: must be passed as image.numpy()
2. **kwargs - might, might not, tbd.

****************
** 2023.10.22 **
****************

Need to fix:

1. Snow parameters in perturbation_levels.py, to have a linear-ish change in the distance metrics.

2. Create figures with unit_tests.py

2. Finish off zoom_blur, create figures and build table.

****************
** 2023.10.23 **
****************

1. Finished all perturbations

2. Tomorrow, run batch and generate perturbation table

3. Thursday - CIFAR10

****************
** 2023.10.28 **
****************

The use of perturbations.py class needs to change, such that when calling, only numpy arrays are used. Code needs to be checked such that when calling Perturbations member class functions, tensors are converted to numpy arrays, and converted back to tensors if required, from the calling code. That means modifiying Perturbations.py contrast member function, and mnist_cnn_eval.py.

****************
** 2023.10.29 **
****************

Building tables. Build preliminary tables. Work to be done on perturbations i.e. contrast needs to be inverted and so on.

** Downtime work
 1. Remove warnings, errors
 2. Add all images - with pertubations
 3. Unpickle vanilla_cnn_mnist_contrast_3.0_to_minus_1.0_20231119194232.pkl and plot contrast level x accuracy
 
Created vanilla_cnn_mnist_contrast_3.0_to_minus_1.0_20231119194232.pkl, with contrast going from 3.0 to -1.0. With accuracy varying from a max of 96.0 at 3.0 to a min of 16/67 at -0.8, while shooting up to 9.74 at -0.9 and -1.0, with very high Bhattacharya Distance and KLD, and low HI. Which suggests something weird is going on.

****************
** 2023.11.26 **
****************

1. Unpickled vanilla_cnn_mnist_contrast_3.0_to_minus_1.0_20231119194232.pkl and plotted contrast level x accuracy. Also added table with Constrast Level, Accuracy, BD, KL and HI in work in progress.

Created vanilla_cnn_mnist_brightness_0.1_to_2.0_20231126195852.pkl. Commit 492ea56

Found a youtube channel:

This video specifically deals with training a CNN to steer:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhBK3GWqNyE

The github repo has jupyter notebooks with code, including driving with reinforcement learning, which looks promissing e.g.:

https://github.com/vadim7s/SelfDrive/blob/master/RL/carenv.py

line 191:

self.sensor.listen(lambda data: self.process_img(data))

Which seem to suggest noise can be added to the data before passing onto agent.

Note, the model was not saved. Another run required with modified code to save model.

Finished reading the AI-Scientist paper. Next, run with compressed networks:

From 19.08.2025:

"Hi Daniel,

There's something wrong with the submitted pdf on Research Manager. I returned the submission to you so you can update the thesis pdf file, please.

A lot of the materials in the current pdf (code, experiment setup, intermediate results) should be removed from the main body of the thesis into a separate appendix.

The thesis should have some 150 pages maximum and it should follow the structure of your transfer report: Abstract, Introduction, Background, Related Work, Method, Results, Discussion, Conclusion and Future Work.

Best,
Artur"

Approach:
1. Proof read and archive sections that are not wanted.
2. Remove appendix
3. Create separate appendix
4. Re-submit thesis

1. Abstract, Introduction, Background, Related Work, Method, Results, Discussion, Conclusion and Future Work.

2025.08.31

The text needs converting to passive voice

For your transfer/phd thesis you used/plan to use:
Passive voice: Cosine similarity was used...
Impersonal: This study presents...
First person singular: I used cosine similarity...
First person plural: We used cosine similarity...

2025.09.03
Had meeting with Artur who suggested that in the Introduction two or more contributions are listed, then
have an applications chapter with the contributions.

Contribution 1 - LOD paper, metrics to quantify confidence
Contribution 2 - Same metrics applied to the CARLA Simulator

New structure

Introduction
Background (pro)

2025.09.08

The table of contents has been reduced by combined sections and removing section headers, where the section headers are now boldface type strings.

Todos
1. The second contribution chapter needs to be written, though this is mainly a copy-and-paste from existing sections. This is also a good exercise and the output should form the basis of a paper or who knows, maybe even a journal paper, about the application of the softmax space to self-driving lane invasion detection, via a regression to classification transform.

2. 7.2 requires discussion for the best performing and additional models. There are plenty of plots and tables, and generating short paragraphs discussing each results should not be much of a problem.

3. For the VLM results, there is plenty on the (now omitted) results appendix that tells a story about scene understanding, and how prompts were refined to elicit the optimal answers.

4. The discussion could probably do with a roundup of what has gone on.

5. Conclusion deserves a visit and lots of love, maybe move key contributions from Discussion to conclusion.

6. Future Work
We really need to go to town here. There is probably a lot that can be done with LLMs and embedding spaces, and since "everything is a vector", there is no end to what kind of relations between uncertainty and distance metrics could be found

7. Finally, this thesis needs READING from start to finish, get rid of all typos and remove as many intermediate results as possible. Might be able to get it down to 100 pages.

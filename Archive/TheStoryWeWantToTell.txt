Introduction

We want to include experiments, potential papers in the write-up:
1. MSc - udacity simulator + paper, we want to format it in a way that it could be put on Arxiv
2. Zivid camera, findings. We want to format it in a way that it could be put on Arxiv
3. ECAI submission
4. CGVC submissing

We want to include a section TBC, with results from the carla simulator, also to turn into a paper

We want to include the "nanny-net" paper, with the network trained on softmax outputs, plus a new method for measuring distances to centroids. We keep a (10,10) threshold instead of a (10) threshold i.e. we create 90 pairs (diagonal does not count) of results.

Include papers in appendixes.

Papers

ECAI 2023 - some results, not much written. Exclude
ECAI 2024 - include
CGVC 2024 - include
MSC Thesis - shorten and include

Meeting (other doctoral students) useful for finding synergies

"No clear overarching plan" - at the moments

"Direction is down to us"

Robin experience in industry

Links in industry

Try to strengthen connection 

Data (common to group) - find

Having a scenario - important, let's find one

Twitter - Tesla - Full Moon on horizon problem 

Scenarios - originally rain creating anomaly
account and explain exceptions

"long tail" (Karpathy)

Amber traffic lights

amber fewer examples

1. Collect data - do something practical and compare models
2. Make sense - how models are managing or failing to deals with exceptions

How do we make sense of how models are dealing with those

"Main novelty of PhD" 

Focus on a scenario - simple example with some data and 

Closer on engineering task

Closer on decision making

Use simulator to evaluate enough data to perform direct comparison

Think about infrastructure

Papers - proving that something holds / probabilistic models
all the way to provide an explanation

Bear in mind

"HOw a look 

logical rules
proofs

* Verify learning system

Scenario 2011 - makes sense not to use RBM - AE

train a simple modle

Safety - avoiding crash
Probabilistic - different levels of expertise

Specify - specify logic - can get ugly
but borrow specially related to Robustness

"Create dataset of problem cases"
"Rush those examples"

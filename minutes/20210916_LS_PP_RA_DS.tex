1. Searched "Mobileye Certification"

July 2020 - Mobileye wins permit to test autonomous vehicles in Germany

first non-OEMs to receive a driverless vehicle test permit from German regulators. Volkswagen and BMW, among others, have been testing in German cities, including Hamburg, since mid-2019.

It is significant that TUV SUD is a "Technical Inspection Association", it ensures operational safety by verifying vehicle safety, functional safety and cyber security, though Risk Assessment, Gap Analysis, Validation / Testing and finally generating reports and documents, then submitted to "official bodies" (undisclosed) who then issue the permission.

TUV SUD considers
"Relevant topics in autonomous driving"

* Simulation
* IT Security

The testing, remembering testing leads to certification, procedure combines "real world tests and simulation"

"TÜV SÜD experts and their partners in the PEGASUS project have been following a hybrid approach, in which the safety tests are largely conducted in virtual simulations and selected representative scenarios are performed on test grounds or in the field. This combination of virtual and real-world tests should cover the whole spectrum of driverless functions and ensure their safety."
 
Q: How did TUV SUB become involved in AV certification ?

A: PEGASUS RESEARCH PROJECT

https://www.pegasusprojekt.de/en/home

SECURING AUTOMATED DRIVING EFFECTIVELY.

PEGASUS delivers the standards for the automation of the future. With the PEGASUS joint project, promoted by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), key gaps in the field of testing of highly-automated driving functions will be concluded by the middle of 2019.

Project Partners (goto https://www.pegasusprojekt.de/en/home then top left hamburguer link):
(...)
Audi
BMW
Daimler
VW (these account for 14\% approx or cars manufactured globally, or 1 in 7 cars manufactured globally.
TUV SUD

So it seems the project has a critical mass

Note BMW, VW and "other german carmakers" have been testing since mid 2019, when Project Pegasus was scheduled to conclude.

Other cited documents:

https://www.iso.org/standard/73928.html

"This document focuses on system-initiated and human-initiated transitions (Clause 6) from a higher level to a lower level of automated driving"

"This approach will aid research design by ensuring that important factors are considered and support consistency across studies enabling meaningful comparisons of findings. This document also includes information on considerations in test scenario design (Clause 9), common measures for human takeover performance (Clause 10) and considerations in choosing a testing environment (Clause 11) to help readers design experiments comparable to other studies."

WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

If the research question is "How do you prove an SD/AV is safe?" then
CAE - Robin
Probabilistic/Statistical - Lorenzo

If the research question is "why is the SD/AV safe" then
Explainability - Artur

Applied to a Simulation Scenario

In the context of what Intel are (Probably) looking for:

1. Validate SD/AV as provided by Mobileye and subsidiary companies

Where does is a simulation placed in the certification/approvals space?

1. Simulation
2. Cybersecurity (running model is software)


Note, TUV SUD seems to have done quite a bit of work on this topic already, so perhaps INTEL has some comments on what type of Safety Assurance they are looking for, after all, in cases the certification authority puts the onus on the customer (manufacturer wishing to get a product to market) to prove product is safe.

Examples, HART association, provides software, expect system to run for weeks, expects an output log.

Progress report

* Access to HPC - I now have
* Started on template for Transfer Report
* Article submission to NeurIPS 2021


TODOS

1. Desk, looking at swapping for tidier desk
2. In touch with IT about logging into A304 terminals
3. Waiting to hear on high-end PC
4. Waiting to hear on licensing Mathematica

Operational Design Domain
Definitions

An Operational Design Domain (ODD) is
“ 	[a] description of the specific operating domain(s) in which an automated function or system is designed to properly operate, including but not limited to roadway types, speed range, environmental conditions (weather, daytime/nighttime, etc.), and other domain constraints.[1] 	”
“ 	[t]he specific conditions under which a given driving automation system or feature thereof is designed to function, including, but not limited to, driving modes. This can incorporate a variety of limitations, such as those from geography, traffic, speed, and roadways.[2]

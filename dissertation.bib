        abstract = {Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in various application domains ranging from image recognition to language translation and game playing. However, it is now generally accepted that deep learning alone has not been able to satisfy the requirement of fairness and, ultimately, trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper, we propose an interactive neural-symbolic approach for fairness in AI based on the Logic Tensor Network (LTN) framework. We show that the extraction of symbolic knowledge from LTN-based deep networks combined with fairness constraints offer a general method for instilling fairness into deep networks via continual learning. Explainable AI approaches which otherwise could identify but not fix fairness issues are shown to be enriched with an ability to improve fairness results. Experimental results on three real-world data sets used to predict income, credit risk and recidivism in financial applications show that our approach can satisfy fairness metrics while maintaining state-of-the-art classification performance.}

        abstract = {Semantic Image Interpretation (SII) is the task of extracting structured semantic descriptions from images. It is widely agreed that the combined use of visual data and background knowledge is of great importance for SII. Recently, Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) approaches have been developed for reasoning under uncertainty and learning in the presence of data and rich knowledge. Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) are a SRL framework which integrates neural networks with first-order fuzzy logic to allow (i) efficient learning from noisy data in the presence of logical constraints, and (ii) reasoning with logical formulas describing general properties of the data. In this paper, we develop and apply LTNs to two of the main tasks of SII, namely, the classification of an image's bounding boxes and the detection of the relevant part-of relations between objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of SRL to such SII tasks. The proposed approach is evaluated on a standard image processing benchmark. Experiments show that background knowledge in the form of logical constraints can improve the performance of purely data-driven approaches, including the state-of-theart Fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Fast R-CNN). Moreover, we show that the use of logical background knowledge adds robustness to the learning system when errors are present in the labels of the training data.}

abstract = {This paper presents a revision of Real Logic and its implementation with Logic Tensor
Networks and its application to Semantic Image Interpretation. Real Logic is a framework
where learning from numerical data and logical reasoning are integrated using first
order logic syntax. The symbols of the signature of Real Logic are interpreted in
the data-space, i.e, on the domain of real numbers. The integration of learning and
reasoning obtained in Real Logic allows us to formalize learning as approximate satisfiability
in the presence of logical constraints, and to perform inference on symbolic and numerical
data. After introducing a refined version of the formalism, we describe its implementation
into Logic Tensor Networks which uses deep learning within Google's TensorFlow™. We
evaluate LTN on the task of classifying objects and their parts in images, where we
combine state-of-the-art-object detectors with a part-of ontology. LTN outperforms
the state-of-the-art on object classification, and improves the performances on part-of
relation detection with respect to a rule-based baseline.},

        abstract = {Responsible gambling is an area of research and industry which seeks to understand the pathways to harm from gambling and implement programmes to reduce or prevent harm that gambling might cause. There is a growing body of research that has used gambling behavioural data to model and predict harmful gambling, and the industry is showing increasing interest in technologies that can help gambling operators to better predict harm and prevent it through appropriate interventions. However, industry surveys and feedback clearly indicate that in order to enable wider adoption of such data-driven methods, industry and policy makers require a greater understanding of how machine learning methods make these predictions. In this paper, we make use of the TREPAN algorithm for extracting decision trees from Neural Networks and Random Forests. We present the first comparative evaluation of predictive performance and tree properties for extracted trees, which is also the first comparative evaluation of knowledge extraction for safer gambling. Results indicate that TREPAN extracts better performing trees than direct learning of decision trees from the data. Overall, trees extracted with TREPAN from different models offer a good compromise between prediction accuracy and interpretability. TREPAN can produce decision trees with extended tests rules of different forms, so that interpretability depends on multiple factors. We present detailed results and a discussion of the trade-offs with regard to performance and interpretability and use in the gambling industry.}

        abstract = {Responsible gambling is a field of study that involves supporting gamblers so as to reduce the harm that their gambling activity might cause. Recently in the literature, machine learning algorithms have been introduced as a way to predict potentially harmful gambling based on patterns of gambling behavior, such as trends in amounts wagered and the time spent gambling. In this paper, neural network models are analyzed to help predict the outcome of a partial proxy for harmful gambling behavior: when a gambler ?self-excludes?, requesting a gambling operator to prevent them from accessing gambling opportunities. Drawing on survey and interview insights from industry and public officials as to the importance of interpretability, a variant of the knowledge extraction algorithm TREPAN is proposed which can produce compact, human-readable logic rules efficiently, given a neural network trained on gambling data. To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports the first industrial-strength application of knowledge extraction from neural networks, which otherwise are black-boxes unable to provide the explanatory insights which are crucially required in this area of application. We show that through knowledge extraction one can explore and validate the kinds of behavioral and demographic profiles that best predict self-exclusion, while developing a machine learning approach with greater potential for adoption by industry and treatment providers. Experimental results reported in this paper indicate that the rules extracted can achieve high fidelity to the trained neural network while maintaining competitive accuracy and providing useful insight to domain experts in responsible gambling.}

% Relational learning can be described as the task of learn-
% ing a first-order logic theory from examples (Dˇzeroski and
%Lavraˇc 2001; De Raedt 2008). Differently from proposi-
%tional learning, relational learning does not use a set of at-
%tributes and values. Instead, it is based on objects and rela-
%tions among objects, which are represented by constants and
%predicates, respectively. This enables a range of applications
%of machine learning, for example in bioinformatics, graph
%mining and link analysis in social networks, serious games,

        abstract = {Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in various application domains ranging from image recognition to language translation and game playing. However, it is now generally accepted that deep learning alone has not been able to satisfy the requirement of fairness and, ultimately, trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper, we propose an interactive neural-symbolic approach for fairness in AI based on the Logic Tensor Network (LTN) framework. We show that the extraction of symbolic knowledge from LTN-based deep networks combined with fairness constraints offer a general method for instilling fairness into deep networks via continual learning. Explainable AI approaches which otherwise could identify but not fix fairness issues are shown to be enriched with an ability to improve fairness results. Experimental results on three real-world data sets used to predict income, credit risk and recidivism in financial applications show that our approach can satisfy fairness metrics while maintaining state-of-the-art classification performance.}

        abstract = {Semantic Image Interpretation (SII) is the task of extracting structured semantic descriptions from images. It is widely agreed that the combined use of visual data and background knowledge is of great importance for SII. Recently, Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) approaches have been developed for reasoning under uncertainty and learning in the presence of data and rich knowledge. Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) are a SRL framework which integrates neural networks with first-order fuzzy logic to allow (i) efficient learning from noisy data in the presence of logical constraints, and (ii) reasoning with logical formulas describing general properties of the data. In this paper, we develop and apply LTNs to two of the main tasks of SII, namely, the classification of an image's bounding boxes and the detection of the relevant part-of relations between objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of SRL to such SII tasks. The proposed approach is evaluated on a standard image processing benchmark. Experiments show that background knowledge in the form of logical constraints can improve the performance of purely data-driven approaches, including the state-of-theart Fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Fast R-CNN). Moreover, we show that the use of logical background knowledge adds robustness to the learning system when errors are present in the labels of the training data.}

abstract = {This paper presents a revision of Real Logic and its implementation with Logic Tensor
Networks and its application to Semantic Image Interpretation. Real Logic is a framework
where learning from numerical data and logical reasoning are integrated using first
order logic syntax. The symbols of the signature of Real Logic are interpreted in
the data-space, i.e, on the domain of real numbers. The integration of learning and
reasoning obtained in Real Logic allows us to formalize learning as approximate satisfiability
in the presence of logical constraints, and to perform inference on symbolic and numerical
data. After introducing a refined version of the formalism, we describe its implementation
into Logic Tensor Networks which uses deep learning within Google's TensorFlow™. We
evaluate LTN on the task of classifying objects and their parts in images, where we
combine state-of-the-art-object detectors with a part-of ontology. LTN outperforms
the state-of-the-art on object classification, and improves the performances on part-of
relation detection with respect to a rule-based baseline.},

        abstract = {Responsible gambling is an area of research and industry which seeks to understand the pathways to harm from gambling and implement programmes to reduce or prevent harm that gambling might cause. There is a growing body of research that has used gambling behavioural data to model and predict harmful gambling, and the industry is showing increasing interest in technologies that can help gambling operators to better predict harm and prevent it through appropriate interventions. However, industry surveys and feedback clearly indicate that in order to enable wider adoption of such data-driven methods, industry and policy makers require a greater understanding of how machine learning methods make these predictions. In this paper, we make use of the TREPAN algorithm for extracting decision trees from Neural Networks and Random Forests. We present the first comparative evaluation of predictive performance and tree properties for extracted trees, which is also the first comparative evaluation of knowledge extraction for safer gambling. Results indicate that TREPAN extracts better performing trees than direct learning of decision trees from the data. Overall, trees extracted with TREPAN from different models offer a good compromise between prediction accuracy and interpretability. TREPAN can produce decision trees with extended tests rules of different forms, so that interpretability depends on multiple factors. We present detailed results and a discussion of the trade-offs with regard to performance and interpretability and use in the gambling industry.}

        abstract = {Responsible gambling is a field of study that involves supporting gamblers so as to reduce the harm that their gambling activity might cause. Recently in the literature, machine learning algorithms have been introduced as a way to predict potentially harmful gambling based on patterns of gambling behavior, such as trends in amounts wagered and the time spent gambling. In this paper, neural network models are analyzed to help predict the outcome of a partial proxy for harmful gambling behavior: when a gambler ?self-excludes?, requesting a gambling operator to prevent them from accessing gambling opportunities. Drawing on survey and interview insights from industry and public officials as to the importance of interpretability, a variant of the knowledge extraction algorithm TREPAN is proposed which can produce compact, human-readable logic rules efficiently, given a neural network trained on gambling data. To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports the first industrial-strength application of knowledge extraction from neural networks, which otherwise are black-boxes unable to provide the explanatory insights which are crucially required in this area of application. We show that through knowledge extraction one can explore and validate the kinds of behavioral and demographic profiles that best predict self-exclusion, while developing a machine learning approach with greater potential for adoption by industry and treatment providers. Experimental results reported in this paper indicate that the rules extracted can achieve high fidelity to the trained neural network while maintaining competitive accuracy and providing useful insight to domain experts in responsible gambling.}

% Relational learning can be described as the task of learn-
% ing a first-order logic theory from examples (Dˇzeroski and
%Lavraˇc 2001; De Raedt 2008). Differently from proposi-
%tional learning, relational learning does not use a set of at-
%tributes and values. Instead, it is based on objects and rela-
%tions among objects, which are represented by constants and
%predicates, respectively. This enables a range of applications
%of machine learning, for example in bioinformatics, graph
%mining and link analysis in social networks, serious games,
%and responsible gambling

\section{CARLA Simulator results}
In this section we document simulation results, describing the code repository commit hash, and any relevant commands and outputs.

\subsection{Run 001 - Installing Carla with apt-get}

We installed Carla following procedure described in:

\begin{verbatim}
https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/start_quickstart/#carla-installation
\end{verbatim}

i.e. with apt-get. The startup procedure differs in that we do not use 
Unreal Engine directly, though the assumption is, it must be installed.
The version can be seen in the dist sub-directory:

\begin{verbatim}
)$ ls -l /opt/carla-simulator/PythonAPI/carla/dist/
total 119796
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 32244452 Nov 17  2021 
carla-0.9.13-cp27-cp27mu-manylinux_2_27_x86_64.whl
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 29700064 Nov 17  2021 
carla-0.9.13-cp37-cp37m-manylinux_2_27_x86_64.whl
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 31615292 Nov 15  2021 
carla-0.9.13-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 29102504 Nov 15  2021 
carla-0.9.13-py3.7-linux-x86_64.egg
\end{verbatim}

NB additional required packages must be installed:

\begin{verbatim}
cd PythonAPI\examples
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt    
\end{verbatim}

Running is the same as with cloning the app:

\begin{verbatim}
$ git clone https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla.git
$ cd carla
$ ./CarlaUE4.sh
\end{verbatim}

With apt-get install:

\begin{verbatim}
$ cd /opt/carla-simulator/
$ ./CarlaUE4.sh
\end{verbatim}

To generate traffic and weather, scripts are in same location in both cases above:

\begin{verbatim}
$ cd /PythonApi/examples
$ python generate_traffic.py -n 60 -w 100 
# On A different shell
$ python dynamic_weather.py --speed 0.05 
# On a different shell
$ python automatic_control.py
# On a different shell
\end{verbatim}

Optional parameters may be passed to the start-up script:

\begin{verbatim}
$ ./CarlaUE4.sh -carla-server -benchmark -fps=15 -windowed -ResX=800 -ResY=600
\end{verbatim}

e.g. for a set frame rate and window size.

Comment:
Simulator loads ok. The  default number of spawned vehicles is 30 and 
pedestrians (walkers) is 10. To change and other options, see script for 
details. The defaults in this case can be changed by adding switches:
$ python generate_traffic.py -n 60 -w 100

Comment:
The parameter -s (speed) is a denominator in code, see
update_freq = 0.1 / speed_factor
The smaller the number, the less frequent (slower) are the weather updates, 
the greater the number, the more frequent (faster) are the weather updates.

# In another terminal, change directory to PythonAPI/examples, and run
$ python automatic_control.py

Comment:
The sun position changes every two seconds when parameter -s 0.05 is 
passed (0.1 / 0.05 = 2)

To exit the simulation:
1. Ensure dynamic_weather.py is not running or stop with CONTROL + C
2. Stop generate_traffic.py with CONTROL + C
3. Stop dynamic_weather.py with CONTROL + C
4. Stop Unreal Engine

If script generate_traffic.py is not stopped with CONTROL + C, and say CONTROL + Z, may still be running in the background. This will keep a lock on the port.

To list processes (open files) that have port 2000 open:
$ sudo lsof -t -i:2000
3281
3416

To check which process the process ID listed refers to:
$ ps aux | grep 3281
daniel    3281  0.9  0.2 1860476 90348 pts/1   Tl   17:25   0:29 python3 generate_traffic.py

To kill the process:
$ sudo kill -9 3281

Figure \ref{fig:carla-traffic-jam-2}, taken from Unreal Engine, showing the stopped vehicles at the T-junction and is the reverse angle of Figure \ref{fig:carla-traffic-jam}. note there has not been a collision. The algorithm driving each vehicle seems to be stuck by a proximity assessment that is unlikely to change given all vehicles are stopped.

Comment:
Various successive runs, number of vehicles decreasing over time due to collisions. One simulated self-drving vehicle got stuck in the simulation (tipycally it would be destroyed at the end of self-driving simulation) after crashing against a traffic-light post.

Currently code uses a random vehicle chosen in automatic_control.py. All cars vanished from simulation two hours in. Pedestrians still present.

Comment:
Currently code uses a random vehicle chosen in automatic_control.py. All cars vanished from simulation two hours in. Pedestrians still present.

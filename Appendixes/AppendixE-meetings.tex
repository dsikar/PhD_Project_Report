\begin{itemize}
    \item 1. RB briefly described the trade-off between reasoning (depth of detail) and communication (breadth of reach) which assurance cases. Using AI to explain assurance and vice-versa. Differences in assurance cases used in Europe vs US, outcome based, where the goals that have to be met are given (problem is it can be too vague). Prescriptive - "this is what the system needs to do", respectively.
    \item 2. PP briefly described the concept of fragments and substitution, claims about real world, is car safe (define what safe is) substitute with related claim, obligations, defeaters. Suggested I look through SAFECOMP papers e.g. "Computer Safety, Reliability, and Security: SAFECOMP 2014 Workshops: ASCoMS, DECSoS, DEVVARTS, ISSE, ReSA4CI, SASSUR. Florence, Italy, September 8-9, 2014. Proceedings", , Other concept to look into: "digital twins".
    \item 3. RB suggests we (RAC, DS, MS) prepare a couple of "progress" slides for the next ICSR Sync Meeting (2020.08.05).
    \item 4. LS defined the the scope of RAC's current research: to "organise evidence of the arguments"
    \item 5. RAC posted in the chat a link to "Safety Case Templates for Autonomous Systems"

% ICO 
% The UK’s independent authority set up to uphold information rights in the public interest, promoting openness by public bodies and data privacy for individuals.

% ICO 3 key dev areas:
% Information Commissioner’s Office
% Technology Strategy2018-2021
% https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2258299/ico-technology-strategy-2018-2021.pdf
% We will establish Technology Fellowships for post-doctoral experts to enable us to increase our in-house advice and expertise on technology priority areas. Our first appointment will bea two-year post-doctoral role toinvestigate and research the impact of artificial intelligence on data privacy, encompassing big data and machine learning.

% Following on from our successful report on the data protection implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning will produce further reportson emerging technology issues.

% Commissioner’s message - Technology is driving changes to the societal, political, legal and business environment that the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)needs to regulate. The most significant data protection risks to individuals are now driven by the use of new technologies.The risks are broad –from cyber-attacksto the growth of artificial intelligence and machine learning
